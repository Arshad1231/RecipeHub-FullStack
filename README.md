# RecipeHub-FullStack 🍲

RecipeHub-FullStack is a full-stack web application for managing and sharing recipes — allowing users to browse, create, edit, and save their favorite recipes via a unified frontend + backend setup.  

## 🚀 What is RecipeHub-FullStack  

RecipeHub-FullStack provides a seamless environment where users can:  
- View a list of recipes  
- Add new recipes  
- Edit or delete existing recipes  
- Browse details of a recipe (ingredients, instructions, etc.)  

The project follows a standard full-stack JS architecture: a backend server and a frontend client.  

## 🧰 Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Node.js / Express  for server-side logic and APIs  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript stack ( React / plain JS + HTML/CSS) for UI and client-side rendering  
- **Other**: Standard web development tools (e.g. npm, package management)  

## 📝 What’s in the Repo  

```
/backend    — server-side code, routes, API logic  
/frontend   — client-side code, UI components, JS/CSS/HTML  
README.md   — (this) project description and usage instructions  
(plus other supporting files/folders as needed)
```  

## 🔧 How to Run Locally  

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arshad1231/RecipeHub-FullStack.git
cd RecipeHub-FullStack
```  

2. Install dependencies for backend and frontend (if separated):  
```bash
# Example: assuming npm is used
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
```  

3. Start the backend server and frontend client (or as per your setup):  
```bash
# Example
cd backend
npm start
cd ../frontend
npm start
```  

4. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) to view the app.  

## ✅ Features  

- CRUD operations for recipes (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Clean separation between backend and frontend  
-

## 🧑‍💻 Why This Project  

I built this project to practice full-stack JavaScript development and create a simple — yet complete — recipe management web app. It demonstrates how to structure a full-stack project, connect frontend and backend, and manage data flow in a modular way.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Planned / Possible)  

- Add user authentication and profiles  
- Enable saving/favoriting recipes per user  
- Add search, filtering, categories, tags  
- Improve UI/UX (responsive design, recipe images, styling)  
- Add validations, error handling, security enhancements  
- Optionally integrate with external recipe APIs for more content
